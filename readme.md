## stacktrace

Following the trail through source code. Where curiosity meets engineering.

This is my scratchpad for [stacktrace](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7399516392682655744/) - a newsletter on LinkedIn where I deep dive into open source projects, with a focus on the code itself. An interesting comment, a magic number, a clever hack — it's all about showing people how fun, weird, and fascinating code can be.
